Take-home Assessment 6: Anagram Solver

## Program Behavior
An anagram is a word or phrase made by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. For example, the words “midterm” and “trimmed” are anagrams. If you ignore spaces and capitalization and allow multiple words, a multi-word phrase can be an anagram of some other word or phrase. For example, the phrases “Clint Eastwood” and “old west action” are anagrams. In this assessment, you will create a class called AnagramSolver that uses a dictionary to print all anagram phrases of a given word or phrase. You will use recursive backtracking to implement your algorithm. We have provided you with a client program, AnagramMain, that prompts the user for a phrase and then passes that phrase to your AnagramSolver, which will then print all its anagrams.
